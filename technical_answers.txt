What are the supported data types in Python?
The types:
* int
* float
* str
* tuples
* set
* list
* dict


What is the difference between tuples and lists in Python?
The main difference is the immutability, that means while the list can be mutated to a new list
(appending a item), the tuple is the opposite, this is related to the concept of hashing,
and that's why we can use a tuple and not list as a key in a dictionary, the hash of the tuple is always the same
and the hash of the list could change over the time.


What are Python decorators?
Decorators are function that wrap another function with the purpose of doing certain
task over the result of the wrapped function


What are generators in Python?
Generators are functions that help us to create iterators, are handy when we dont need to iterate over
a certain set of items in the same iteration, means we can get next value of the iterators when a certain condition is met.
(yield and next)

What are shallow and deep copy operations?
A shallow copy keeps the same reference to the value in the memory, let's suppose that we have a dict
and we create a new variable and assign the dict variable, then if we make an operation on any variable
the operation is gonna be reflected when make use of the another variable, sometimes this leads to certain
misbehavior.

A deep copy means that we create a new value in the memory, so if we make a operation on any state, that means the another variable or state
will not suffer any change.

Explain Dependency Injection?
This is a concept that means we pass the a Dependency a certain class in the constructor of the class, 
instead the class create a new instance of the Dependency, decoupling the classes(Too, is related to Dependency Inversion Principle)

Explain how you can make a Python Script executable on Unix?
we can add "#!/usr/bin/env python" in the head of our python file
and change the permissions of the python file to be executable
